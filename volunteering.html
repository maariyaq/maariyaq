                <h3>Being ME</h3>
                <p>At Being ME our mission is to connect and empower women and girls to ignite change. We host various programs throughout the year including the annual Being ME women's conference that started in 2011 -- now the largest women's conference in North America. Our annual conference regularly hosts 3000 attendees at the Metro Toronto Convention Center.<br>I started working with Being ME around 2016 as a volunteer at their conference. Then starting in 2019 and throughout the pandemic I was an MC for their monthly Girl Talk events. Currently I am the Youth Connect Stream Lead; my job is to oversee all programs that operate under the Youth Connect stream, and provide guidance and support.</p>
