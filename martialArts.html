                <h3>Martial Arts Career</h3>

                    <p>What shaped you as a person? What destroyed you, built you, and gave you some of your favorite memories? For me, its my martial arts journey.<br>
                        <br>
                    I started when I was 9 years old, with my brother and my dad. My parents wanted us to get more active and thought Karate would be a good choice - they couldnâ€™t have been more right! I quickly built a passion for it, and loved every second of class. Throughout my 10 years in martial arts, it has greatly influenced my character, mindset, and confidence, and I have many fond memories of tournaments and training.<br>
                        <br>
                    Today, 10 years later, I hold a junior black belt in Karate and have placed in the top 3 eight times at various tournaments. Iâ€™ve also trained with the sai, bo staff, and nunchaku as part of my Kobudo training.</p>

                <h3>My experience as a girl in Martial Arts</h3>
                <section class="karateBlurb">
                    <img src="comp_sci_2.jpeg" alt="Tournament image"/>
                    <p>The truth about being a girl in martial arts is . . .<br>
            People have a lot of misconceptions about our experience ðŸ˜‚<br><br>
            Some girls feel nervous about joining a majority-male dojo. Others are worried they will be treated unfairly compared to their male counterparts. <br><br>
            Iâ€™m grateful to say that I have never experienced any truth to these concerns. My dojo was majority male, and many times I was the only girl in class. But my sensei (teacher) always gave me equal attention and instruction, and oftentimes went out of his way to give all students extra help where needed. <br><br>
            Martial Arts is a wonderful discipline that builds discipline and confidence in anyone who studies it, and I highly recommend everyone experience it at least once in their life.</p>
